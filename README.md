# CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF DATA SCIENCE SKILLS IN JOB POSTINGS

This project delves into the realm of data science and artificial intelligence, encompassing various stages from data collection and cleaning to exploratory data analysis, hierarchical clustering, and feature engineering for KMeans clustering.

## Data Collection and Cleaning

Data sourced from Indeed job postings underwent thorough cleaning after being scraped using provided web-scraping code. Segmented collection targeted California, USA, and New York, USA, resulting in 800 unique postings post-duplicate removal.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Utilizing the ChatGPT API and manual research, essential data science skills were identified and analyzed for their occurrence in job descriptions, shedding light on trends within the data science job market.

## Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering techniques were employed to group data science-specific skills, revealing distinct clusters with similar characteristics, crucial for curriculum design and skill segmentation.

## Feature Engineering for KMeans Clustering

A dataset was engineered with features explaining skills within job postings, facilitating KMeans clustering to identify skill clusters, aiding in curriculum design and educational planning.

## Final Course Curriculum

Comparison of clustering methods highlighted the effectiveness of hierarchical clustering in producing cohesive curriculum designs, providing insights into organizing essential skills for data science roles.

## Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into curriculum design for data science education, leveraging clustering techniques to understand and organize the diverse skill sets essential for success in the field.
